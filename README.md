# HTML2Wiki

Simple HTML to MediaWiki markup converter.

So far it only has support for basic tags (p, h1-6, a, b, i, ul, ol, br) as I
wrote this to rescue contents from an old wiki for which I only had HTML
backups and that was all I needed, but adding support for tables and other
fancy stuff should be fairly easy.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'html2wiki'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install html2wiki
